# PDE_DIffusion_NM2b

Project for a term paper in the course Numerical Methods in Classical Field Theory and Quantum Mechanics as part of Computer Simulation in Science (Msc CSiS) Master's program in Bergische Universitaet Wuppertal, Germany. 

In this project the Diffusion equation is solved with a forward-time-center-space (FTCS) method using MPI.
